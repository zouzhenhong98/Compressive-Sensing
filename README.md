# Compressed-Sensing
A repo to introduce compressive sensing technique, from classic to modern, mostly based on book notes and paper annotation. Additionally, it is also established for my final paper as a student in computational mathematics. Welcome to contact e-mail: joebuaa2016@foxmail.com
一个从经典到现代介绍压缩感知技术的仓库，主要基于书本笔记和论文笔记。同时，这也是我的毕设论文资料存储仓库。如有问题探讨，欢迎联系：joebuaa2016@foxmail.com

TODO:
- [ ] read current papers and add notes
- [ ] read the book: Compressed Sensing _ Theory and Applications (2012)
- [x] read the website and conclude basic ideas of CS.
